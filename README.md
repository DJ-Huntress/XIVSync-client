# XIVSync-client
A Mare fork that claims to be transparent, yet hides the client code, in violation of AGPL

btw, you can bypass the anti-PCP export by setting the environment variable `XIVSYNC_DISABLE_EXPORT_GUARD` to `1`, because they decided to vibe code you a false sense of security instead of doing anything valuable
